        <h2>What is a README file</h2>
        <p>
          A README file can be added to the repository to tell other people why
          the project is useful, what they can do with the project, and how they
          can use it...

        <h2>What is a WIREFRAME</h2>
        <p>
          A wireframe is the skeleton of your digital project. Think of it as
          the foundation for your website, app, or dashboard. It focuses on
          layout, and content placement—not on colors, fonts, or any visual
          polish...

        <h2>What is a GIT BRANCH</h2>
        <p>
          Use a branch to isolate development work without affecting other
          branches in the repository. Each repository has one default branch,
          and can have multiple other branches. You can merge a branch into
          another branch using a pull request...
